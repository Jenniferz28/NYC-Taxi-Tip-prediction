# NYC-Taxi-Tip-prediction
Analyzed the NYC green taxi behavior and visualized the trip pattern (location, time, etc) in python.
Deployed gradient boosting regression to predict the tip percentage achieving 0.02 MSE at test data.
The data is collected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about "Green" Taxis. 
Green Taxis (as opposed to yellow ones) are taxis that are not allowed to pick up passengers inside of the densely populated 
areas of Manhattan. http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
